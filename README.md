At the moment I am working on a web application for maintaining a database of customers and sellers of the product, accounting for the use by customers of the services provided by the product.
In my free time, I continue to study AngularJS & Django ORM and libraries for data analysis and machine learning (clustering and deploying an ML model in Heroku using FLASK).
