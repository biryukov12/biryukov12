#### At the moment I am working on a web application for maintaining a database of customers and sellers of the product, accounting for the use by customers of the services provided by the product. In my free time, I continue to study AngularJS & Django ORM and ML ([clustering and deploying an ML model in Heroku using FLASK](https://github.com/biryukov12/deployment-of-ML-model)).
