Currently I am developing a CRM system for the sales department (keeping a database of customers and salespeople of the product, recording the use of customer services, etc.). Project stack: Angular, Django ORM, PostgreSQL, Docker.<br>
In my spare time I continue to learn SQL, Django, FastAPI+sqlalchemy, JS frameworks and ML ([clustering and deploying an ML model in Heroku using FLASK](https://github.com/biryukov12/deployment-of-ML-model)).
